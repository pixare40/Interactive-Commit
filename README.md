# 🎵 Interactive-Commit

**Transform your git commits with the soundtrack of your code.**

Interactive-Commit is a git hook that automatically appends your currently playing audio to commit messages, creating a rich narrative of your development journey. **Working solution for WSL2/Windows environments!**

![Commit Example](https://img.shields.io/badge/🎵%20Currently%20playing-"Hamnitishi%20(feat.%20Talia%20Oyando)"%20by%20E--Sir%20(Spotify)-green)

## 🌟 Vision

Imagine correlating your most productive coding sessions with your playlist, or looking back at old commits and remembering the exact mood when you wrote that breakthrough algorithm. This isn't just about fun commit messages - it's about creating data that could revolutionize how we understand developer productivity.

**Future Possibilities:**
- 🎯 **Developer Analytics**: Spotify/YouTube Music insights for optimal coding playlists
- 📊 **Team Coordination**: Shared soundtracks for better collaboration  
- 🧠 **Productivity Research**: Correlate music genres with code quality and bug rates
- 💼 **Enterprise Features**: Mood-based development environment optimization

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install the CLI tool
go install github.com/pixare40/interactive-commit@latest

# Option 1: Install for current repository only
interactive-commit install --local

# Option 2: Install globally for ALL repositories (recommended!)
interactive-commit install --global

# Make a commit and watch the magic happen!
git add . && git commit -m "fix: resolve authentication bug"
# Result: Your commit message + 🎵 Currently playing: "Focus Flow" by Lo-Fi Study Beats (Spotify)
```

## 🎯 Features

- **🎵 Universal Audio Detection**: Works with Spotify, YouTube Music, Chrome, Edge, Firefox
- **🌍 WSL2/Windows Bridge**: Breakthrough solution for cross-platform audio detection
- **🔒 Privacy-First**: All audio data stays local on your machine

## 🔧 Platform Support

### ✅ Currently Working

| Platform | Audio Source | Method | Status |
|----------|-------------|---------|---------|
| WSL2 | Windows Spotify | Window Title Parsing | ✅ **Working** |
| WSL2 | Windows Browsers | Window Title Parsing | ✅ **Working** |
| Linux Native | MPRIS/D-Bus | `playerctl` | ✅ **Working** |

### 🚧 WSL2/Windows Integration (Our Breakthrough!)

**The Problem**: WSL2 runs in a separate Linux VM and traditionally can't access Windows audio streams.

**Our Solution**: 
1. **Window Title Bridge**: PowerShell queries Windows process window titles from WSL2
2. **Smart Pattern Matching**: Intelligent parsing of Spotify, YouTube Music, and browser titles
3. **Cross-Platform Communication**: Seamless WSL2 ↔ Windows process interaction

**Example Detection Patterns:**
- **Spotify**: `"Artist - Song Title"` → Parsed to structured data
- **YouTube Music**: `"Song - Artist - YouTube Music"` → Clean extraction  
- **Browser Media**: Generic `"Title - Source"` patterns for web players

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.21+ 
- Git 2.9+
- For WSL2: PowerShell accessible via `powershell.exe`
- For Linux: Optional `playerctl` for MPRIS support

### Install from Source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pixare40/interactive-commit.git
cd interactive-commit
go build -o interactive-commit ./cmd/interactive-commit

# Install locally for current repo only
./interactive-commit install --local

# OR install globally for all repositories
./interactive-commit install --global
```

### Install from Release (Coming Soon)
```bash
# Download binary from GitHub releases
# curl -L https://github.com/pixare40/interactive-commit/releases/latest/download/interactive-commit-linux -o interactive-commit
# chmod +x interactive-commit && ./interactive-commit install --local
```

## 🎮 Usage

### Install Hook

```bash
# Install for current repository only
interactive-commit install --local

# Install globally for ALL repositories (recommended!)
interactive-commit install --global

# Verify installation
interactive-commit detect
```

**Global vs Local Installation:**

| Mode | Command | Scope | Use Case |
|------|---------|-------|----------|
| **Local** | `--local` | Current repository only | Testing, specific projects |
| **Global** | `--global` | All repositories | Default recommendation |

**Global Installation Details:**
- Creates hooks in `~/.config/git/hooks/` (Linux/WSL2)
- Configures Git's `core.hooksPath` globally 
- Works automatically in ALL repositories
- To disable: `git config --global --unset core.hooksPath`

### Test Detection
```bash
# Test what's currently playing
interactive-commit detect

# Example output:
# 🎵 Detecting currently playing audio...
# 📡 Available detectors: 1
#   ✅ WSL2/Windows Media Session
# 
# 🎵 Currently playing:
#    Title:  Hamnitishi (feat. Talia Oyando)
#    Artist: E-Sir
#    Source: Spotify
#    Type:   song
#
# 💬 Commit message addition:
# 🎵 Currently playing: "Hamnitishi (feat. Talia Oyando)" by E-Sir (Spotify)
```

### Make Musical Commits
```bash
# Start playing music, then commit normally
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement user authentication"

# Your commit message automatically becomes:
# feat: implement user authentication
#
# 🎵 Currently playing: "Coding Flow" by Lo-Fi Beats (Spotify)
```

git commit -m "refactor: optimize database queries"
# Result:
# refactor: optimize database queries
#
# 🎵 Currently playing: "Bohemian Rhapsody" by Queen (Spotify)

# Podcast while debugging  
git commit -m "fix: resolve memory leak in worker pool"
# Result:
# fix: resolve memory leak in worker pool
#
# 🎵 Currently playing: "The Changelog #423: Building Better APIs" (YouTube Music)

# Focus music for deep work
git commit -m "feat: implement distributed caching layer"
# Result:
# feat: implement distributed caching layer
#
# 🎵 Currently playing: "Deep Focus" by Brain.fm (Microsoft Edge)
```

## 🔒 Privacy & Data

- **100% Local**: All audio detection happens on your machine
- **No Telemetry**: No data sent to external services
- **No Storage**: Audio info only added to git commits you create
- **Opt-out Anytime**: Simply remove the git hook to disable.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting.

### Global Hooks Not Working?

```bash
# Check if global hooks path is configured
git config --global core.hooksPath

# Should show: /home/username/.config/git/hooks (absolute path)
# If it shows: ~/.config/git/hooks (with tilde), fix it:
git config --global core.hooksPath "$(echo ~/.config/git/hooks)"

# Verify the hook file exists and is executable
ls -la ~/.config/git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg

# Test the hook manually
cd /any/git/repo
interactive-commit detect
```

### WSL2 Audio Detection Issues?

```bash
# Verify PowerShell is accessible
powershell.exe -Command "Write-Host 'PowerShell working'"

# Test audio detection directly
interactive-commit detect
```

### Permission Issues?

```bash
# Make sure hook is executable
chmod +x ~/.config/git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg

# Check Git version (needs 2.9+)
git --version
```
